# Diversity & Inclusion
## Background of your task
Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. Theyâ€™ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but theyâ€™re not seeing any progress. Theyâ€™re reaching out to us for help.

At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Why is this so?

Think about the importance of strategy, awareness and education, analytics and inspiration. 

Here is a hint: Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

* number of women
* number of leavers
* % employees promoted (FY21)
* % of women promoted
* % of hires men
* % of hires women
* % turnover 
* Average performance rating: men
* Average Performance rating: women
