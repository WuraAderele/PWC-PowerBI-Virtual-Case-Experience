# Customer Retention Trends
## Background of your task
A few weeks after presenting your [first dashboard](https://github.com/WuraAderele/PWC-PowerBI-Virtual-Case-Experience/blob/main/Call%20Centre%20Trends/ReadMe.md/ "first dashboard title") to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:
* Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we donâ€™t want to lose them
* The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
* Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
* We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
* We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that itâ€™s self-explanatory for our management

The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section.

## Here is your task
Your colleague, the engagement partner, asks you to do the following tasks:
* Define proper KPIs
* Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
* Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed
